        <p>This is a description on the restaurant... Go ahead, touch the cornballer. Oh…yeah…the guy in the…the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! Oh Gob, you could charm the black off a telegram boy. OH MY GOD, WE'RE HAVING A FIRE… sale. Oh, the burning! ♪♪ Amaaaaaaziiiing Graaaace ♪♪

The tears just aren't coming. </p>
